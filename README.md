# kevinpastor's zmk-config

This is my personal [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/) configuration. It consists of a 42-keys base layout that I use for my Corne keyboard.

## Features

- Integrates [the nice!view Elemental module](https://github.com/kevinpastor/nice-view-elemental) for custom display;
- Has gaming layers crafted for FPS games;
- Implements [urob's "timer-less" homerow mods](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config);
- Built for the Canadian French Windows layout;
- Uses helper macros from
  [zmk-nodefree-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-nodefree-config).

## Layers

### Standard Layers

The overall design of the standard layers has been greatly influenced by the gaming layers described below. The reasoning behind this is to keep the same muscle memory across both groups of layers.

Home row mods is setup to use the right variant of the modifiers on the right hand side to allow to switch hand if the modifier on the wrong hand was pressed. The right hand side `Alt` is the exception to this to avoid having `AltGr` registered with the Canadian French Windows layout.

The Canadian French Windows layout needs to be used in order for the symbols and some other characters to register properly.

Some macro behaviors have been used for symbols because of an issue when using Windows RDP with the keyboard over Bluetooth.

#### Alpha Layer

The alpha layer is based on the Colemak-DH layout. The position of symbols on that layer has been influenced by their usage frequency in both French and English according to [an article from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_punctuation) and [an article from bépo](https://bepo.fr/wiki/Fr%C3%A9quence_des_caract%C3%A8res). Controls and whitespace keys have been placed according to their usage and their usual position on a standard keyboard.

Homerow mods are active for that layer.

#### Symbols Layer

The symbols layer as been greatly inspired by [an article by Pascal Getreuer](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/symbol-layer/index.html). The main difference is the mirroring of its layer to ensure inward rolls are possible for the `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `[`, and `]` keys.

Homerow mods are active for that layer.

#### Miscellaneous Layer

The miscellaneous layer has been designed to provide numbers as well as extra keys like arrows and French accents. 

On the right side, the numbers have been place to mimic the numpad on a standard keyboard. A comma was added to support French decimal numbering notation.

The arrows have been placed on the home row to avoid hand movement. Since the left hand is often used for movement in games using WASD, the position of the up arrow has been decided according to the usual finger on the W key (i.e. the middle finger).

Accents have been placed on a row according to their frequency in French.

Home row mods are only active on the right hand for that layer. This allows long press of the arrow keys. 

#### Functions Layer

The functions layer has been designed to resemble the numbers layer as close as possible. Function keys past `F9` were placed in regards to ergonomics.

The `F13` and `F14` keys have been made available to use as dedicated mute and deafen shortcuts on Discord. They are position and accessed exactly the same on the gaming layers.

Home row mods are not active for that layer. Instead, the left hand side provides the modifier keys "as is" to be able to access them instantly without having to wait for the home row mods timeout. This is useful for side-scrolling with `Shift` and the scroll wheel or for zooming on a page with `Ctrl` and the scroll wheel.

### Gaming Layers

To avoid having to remap every game because of Colemak-DH layout, the gaming layers are setup with QWERTY. The catch: the lefthand side is shifted right by one key to center the navigation keys (WASD) on the home row keys. This leads to better ergonomy at the expense of key compromises: some alpha keys are repositioned on another layer.

To go to the gaming layers (G) from the standard layers, hold the leftmost thumb key and then tap the rightmost thumb key. To go back to the standard layers (S), hold the leftmost thumb key and then tap the rightmost thumb key, same as the other way around.

## Changelog

### 2024-10-31

- Move the gaming layer toggle key as well as the Bluetooth profile selection keys on the other hand.
    - Having the left pinky memorize 6 different actions became problematic in games when F13 was searched, but the key on the other layer was tried instead.

### 2024-10-17

- Replace key presses on the thumb keys on layers with momentary layer behaviors.
    - Nested taps could occur when two characters from different layers were pressed consecutively (e.g., a number followed by a symbol, where the first layer change overlapped the second layer change).

### 2024-10-16

- The gaming layers change key and the Bluetooth behaviors were moved a bit more out of the way 
- Add macros for common use cases.
    - The "cédille" accent in French is exclusively used on the letter c, which made sense to remove the dedicated accent key and replace it with a "c cédille" key.
    - Undo and redo are shortcuts often used but a bit awkward to do with the homerow mods.
